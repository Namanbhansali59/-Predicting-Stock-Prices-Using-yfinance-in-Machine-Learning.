# -Predicting-Stock-Prices-Using-yfinance-in-Machine-Learning.


In this GitHub repository, I present a comprehensive project that revolves around predicting stock prices through the synergy of machine learning techniques and the versatile "yfinance" library. By harnessing the power of Python's "yfinance" for retrieving historical stock data and employing essential libraries such as "pandas," "os," and "plotly.graph_objects," I preprocess and visualize the data for insights. The predictive aspect of the project is powered by a RandomForestRegressor model from the "sklearn" library. I leverage the "train_test_split" function for model training and validation, utilizing metrics like mean squared error to evaluate the model's performance. Throughout the project, I emphasize a practical approach, demonstrating how the fusion of machine learning and financial data analysis can potentially enhance stock price forecasting accuracy. Feel free to explore the code and insights presented here to gain a deeper understanding of this intriguing intersection between technology and finance.
